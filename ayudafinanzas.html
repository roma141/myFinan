    MyFinan is a program that runs on the Internet to help you record and control all incomings and expenses of your money in a comfortable and easy way, from anywhere in the world.<br><br>
    Having stored these incomings and expenses can analyze your spending pattern and with some discipline, control it.<br><br>
    Financially our first goal is to spend less than you earn. It is usually very easy to know how much and how we get the income, but it is very difficult to know how we spend it. Occasionally we do a budget, perhaps initially it worked, but then we see that not; its hard to accepting that we actually we have no control of our expenses and when we do an expense, we dont know how it will affect our finances. We feel that we earn more than we spend, but in reality we are always short of money, or worse, laden with debts.<br><br>
    A customer writes:<br><br>
    &quot;I started using MyFinan in June of 2009, with a high deficit. I handle the money with my wife. Before of myfinan we use a spreadsheet to control it, but it was never possible; we did not succeed on saving or knowing where we were spending the money, but continually argued about this cause. The first was to establish a real budget with MyFinan. I can say that after 3 months, already had a much clearer picture of our expenses and that the budget was fulfilled. Also that the initial deficit had been eliminated and that we soon would start keep some money left over. Now in December I have a little money to withstand the shocks of December. Although in sometimes of my life I left over some money, now I can say that every month left over some money and I am aware of the expenses that I do and how it can affect my finances, something I could never know it with the spreadsheet&quot;

    <h3>Step One</h3>
    <div>
        First of all establish a real budget, not the ideal budget. To do it write for several months in MyFinan your expenses as they occur, <a href="ayudamov.html">How to input a expense</a>. Go simply observing, try not to force anything. Surely with 3 months of observation will be enough. Now lets make the budget's for the accounts:
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed Expenses</li>
        <li>Grocery</li>
        <li>Annual expenses</li>
        <li>Extras expenses</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        Fixed Expenses are those such as utilities, loan fees. All months are given and more or less the same amount.<br>
        Grocery are all expenses made ​​in food including sweets, outings to restaurants.<br>
        Annual expenses are all expenses that are not made every month but are fixed like Birthday, christmas, taxes.<br>
        Extras Expenses are unexpected, it is not known in advance how much you will spend and on what. Any expenditure not falling within the above two categories goes here.<br>
    </div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<div class="container">
    <h3>Step Two</h3>
    <div>
        After three months you should already have an idea of ​​the monthly values ​​of these groups, except for the Annual expenses, but you can make a good estimate. With these "real" values ​​compare with your income and see how much money will be free each month. If you are satisfied go to step 3.<br><br>
        If you are not satisfied, it mean that your income are very little for what you spend or you feel that you are wasting your money somewhere.<br><br>
        If you earn very little, look how to increase your income. Change jobs or find an additional income. As you has survived so far with that income, it means that you probably can cut somewhere.<br><br>
        Look at where you can cut spending and cut them forever, not for a month or a few months. Think about it: sometimes, when we are very short of money, we have to make "sacrifices " for a while. This means that we have reduced expenses at some point, the idea is to make them permanent .<br><br>
        You will say, but if I'll sacrifice myself all the time, what is the gain? We are not talking about a super sacrifice, you can still do some or most of your enjoys, only if you make it more cheap. This means that we can reduce fixed costs or grocery, without starving. The joys that brighten our lives, we are going to do it with the extra expenses, with what is left of the budget.<br><br>
        You can see an example on this <a target="_blank" href="http://thefederalist.com/2016/07/07/the-millennials-six-step-guide-to-financial-independence/">link</a>, you also can find more in the web.<br><br>
        Lets do this reduction forever. It is the only way for us to start saving money every month.<br><br>
        Again, if there is no way to saving some money, you have to earn more.<br><br>

    <h3>Step Three</h3>
    <div>
        Recording in your mind these monthly values ​​and continue adjusting the budget if necessary. These adjustments will be small, if they change a lot, for example taking a new debt, you should return to Step Two.<br><br>
        In everything is fixed, which it is almost all, are not going to be out of budget. You simply has to control extras expenses. For this  you have to postpone to the following month any expenses that may exceed the budget set for Extras.<br><br>
        If you follow these steps or rules, we are sure you will achieve your goal and begin saving money. This surplus money it can be spend as you wish. Take care it, they will appear many friends, including you and will emerge "needs" that do not exist.<br><br>
        MyFinan already achieved its goal to help you with your finances each month.
